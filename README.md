## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/cover.png)

A news application developed using Flutter. Application follows the Clean Architecture principles and it coding with the Bloc pattern. The application accesses news through the News V2 API.

## Built With

Clean Architecture is an approach that ensures clean and sustainable code in software projects. This architecture divides the project into layers, with each layer having specific responsibilities. Typically, a three-layered structure is used: the presentation layer, the domain layer, and the data layer.

The presentation layer is concerned with the user interface and user interaction, often represented by Widgets in Flutter. The Bloc architecture is a pattern used to manage the presentation layer. Blocs receive data, perform operations on it, and deliver the results to the presentation layer.

The domain layer contains the application's rules and functionality. It includes models, business logic rules, and processes relevant to the application context.
